This dashboard explores data  from the Austin Police department. This dashboard contains charts to visualize crime data that explores crime types and crime rates in Austin, Texas and visualize the impact of the COVID pandemic during 2019-2021.


### Data Limitations
This dataset contains a record of incidents that the Austin Police Department responded to and wrote a report. Please note one incident may have several offenses associated with it, but this dataset only depicts the highest level offense of that incident. Data is from 2003 to present.. This database is updated weekly, and a similar or same search done on different dates can produce different results. Comparisons should not be made between numbers generated with this database to any other official police reports. Data provided represents only calls for police service where a report was written. Totals in the database may vary considerably from official totals following investigation and final categorization. Therefore, the data should not be used for comparisons with Uniform Crime Report statistics. (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.austintexas.gov/fdj4-gpfu)
